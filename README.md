I am a Front End Developer taking a Full Stack Development bootcamp. I've developed [Jonnovative](https://www.jonnovative.biz/), a profile website that helped me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design. Other websites I've designed include [Lois Lane Insurance](https://www.loislaneins.com/), as well [Tasty Danish](https://tastydanish.net/) for a graphic artist and BJJ practitioner. I currently work as a Support Analyst at Kimble.


- 🧠 I'm currently working on Kimble, the leading PSA application, which is on Salesforce.
- 👀 I’m currently learning JavaScript (Express, React, Node) and eventually MongoDB for a complete MERN stack.
- ✔️ Big fan of accessibility, user-experience and addictively educational websites.
- ☎️ How to reach me: codefolio.work@gmail.com or Twitter [@jonamichahammo](https://twitter.com/jonamichahammo)
- ⚡ Fun facts: I've done two cage fights, featured at a poetry festival, and testified at multiple government public hearings.
- ⚖️ I'm a big believer in ethics. Let's use our technical abilities to build each other up, not tear each other down!
