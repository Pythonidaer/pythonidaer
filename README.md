I am Front End Developer taking a Full Stack Development bootcamp. I've developed ![Jonnovative](https://jonnovative.biz), a profile website that helped me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design. Other websites I've designed include [Lois Lane Ins](https://loislaneins.com) for an Insurance Agency, and [Tasty Danish](https://tastydanish.net) for a graphic artist and BJJ practitioner. I currently work as a Support Analyst at Kimble.
