I am a Frontend Software Engineer. I've developed several portfolio isntances:  [2020 Portfolio](https://portfoliotestsite.netlify.app/), [2021 Portfolio](https://pythonidaer.github.io/jonnovative-portfolio/), [2023 Portfolio](https://jonathan-hammond.vercel.app/), and most recently my tech blog, [Hammond Bytes](https://hammondbytes.netlify.app). I have created several other pet projects in recent years, using tech stacks such as React, Redux, CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Node.js, Python, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Heroku, Render, Supabase, Railway, and Netlify.

Currently I am learning morea bout Frontend Architecture, Unit Testing, (Frontend) JavaScript Patterns, and a whole lot more. Unofficially powered by Windsurf, ChatGPT and Gemini.

- 🧠 I'm currently #OpenToWork - I focus on JavaScript and React, but would be open to any new technologies.
- 👀 I’m currently learning more about Full Stack Development, and tend to stick with the React Stack (Next.js, React-Router-Dom, React Query, occasionally Redux, etc.).
- ✔️ I'm a big fan of user experience, but I'd rather implement a mock-up than turn into a full-blown designer. I have used Figma plenty of times.

- ⚡ Fun facts: I once let a professional kickboxer stay at my apartment for a month, and he taught me a bit about Islam; I have performed in stand-up comedy and improv; I have sparred with professional boxers
- ⚖️ I'm a big believer in ethics. My ultimate goal is to get paid to have fun with technologies that solve problems afflicting the world.
