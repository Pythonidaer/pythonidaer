# Welcome! My name is Jonathan.

I am Front End Developer taking a Full Stack Development bootcamp. I've developed [Jonnovative](jonnovative.biz), a profile website that helped me learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Responsive Web Design. Other websites I've designed include [Lois Lane Ins](loislaneins.com) for an Insurance Agency, and [Tasty Danish](tastydanish.net) for a graphic artist and BJJ practitioner. I currently work as a Support Analyst at Kimble.
